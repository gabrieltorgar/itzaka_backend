"""From the photo of a paper plan to walls and rooms (US-129).

Claude reads the photo and answers in pixels of the image it saw; the plan gets
them back relative to the photo (0 to 1 on each side), because the editor lays
them over the photo as its background.

Before that reading, the plan's measures are looked for (iteracion-7): a quick
reading of only its cotas tells whether it has its width and its height
written. When one is missing the architect is asked for it, and with them the
reading comes back with its scale — metres per pixel of the polished photo —
so the plan arrives in real metres.

This is a floor plan on paper — printed, or sketched by hand — photographed and \

{width} × {height} pixels.

Trace the plan so an architect can keep editing it:
- walls: one straight segment per wall, centred on the drawn wall, from end to \
end. Split a wall where another wall meets it. Follow the walls that are drawn; \
do not trace furniture, dimension lines, text, hatching or the paper's edge.
- rooms: each space enclosed by walls, as the polygon of its corners in order. \
A door or an open doorway does not open a room: close it along the wall. If the \
space has a name written inside it, give the name exactly as written; \
otherwise give an empty string.

- openings: each door and each window drawn on a wall, as the two points where \
it starts and ends along that wall. A door is a leaf with its swing arc, or a \
gap in the wall; a window is a set of thin parallel lines inside the wall.

- dimensions: each dimension written on the plan (a cota), as the two ends of \
its dimension line and the length it states, in metres: 4.5 for «4.50», «4,50» \
or «450» in centimetres.

Use pixel coordinates of this image, x to the right and y downwards. Trace each \
wall straight through its doors and windows: they go in openings, not as gaps.
If the photo is not a floor plan, or it is too blurry to see the walls, set \
is_floor_plan to false and leave every list empty."""
